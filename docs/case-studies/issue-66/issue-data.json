  "body": "At the moment we only support API token, but we need to also to support Gemini subscriptions with oAuth (or similar flow) like we do for Claude Pro/Max subscriptions.\n\nWe should use reference code at ./original-opencode and ./reference-gemini-cli.\n\nPlease download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to ./docs/case-studies/issue-{id} folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.",
